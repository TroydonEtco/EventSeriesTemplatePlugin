TROUBLEHOOTING


- needed to save as no, for the event to work
- has to be in the current step of BPF too?
- execution context only holds the prop data from the attr submitted with the update Request, the props that have changed.
So better to use pre entity images when needing to use other data for logic calculations.
- Can select to update my custom type conditionally based on the select attribute that is part of the step.
- identified that accidentally selected only a few attr on the wrong step on tje preimage

- getting more in depth with plugin work, russ just debriefed us on the debit success api. Will be giving it a look once im done with all the sams issues.
